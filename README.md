# Techempower Benchmarks Conclusion
https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks is a great tool, but I can't see "higher level" picture of performance for specific language.

Data presented in CSV files is average value for all tests done for specific language. This is why for specific round number 1 language could be in lower places here - because of tests on slower frameworks.

All csv files presents sorted rankings, with three columns: language, average and absolute result, average and relative result [%].
